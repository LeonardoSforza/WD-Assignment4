          <p>
            Overall speaking, the page has good usability and accessibility features. The contents are 
            positioned and divided into sections to guide the users, for example, the display field and input 
            field in the “best selling products” table are separated. This makes the learning process intuitive and
            also makes the page memorable. To increase user satisfaction, we added lots of visual cues (such as big
            and special fonts for the titles, alternate shading for the table rows, and whitespaces between
            sections) to make the page more aesthetic and to ease readability, which allows for users to navigate through the website more 
            pleasantly. The page also has high efficiency, the sorting features in the table allows users to sort
            according to different variables and find the products efficiently. The dynamic table also makes
            editing the table content very efficient. However, more features can be added to guide new users,
            for example, more cues should be provided to indicate which buttons are clickable (e.g., the column 
            title). Further, improvements can still be made so that we will be able to cover the needs of more 
            users. For example, for users with color deficiencies or blindness, we should not depend solely on 
            colors to convey information, and audio cues can be added.

          <p><strong>1.3.1 Info and Relationships</strong></p>
            <p>
              This is very relevant to our website since we focus a lot on responsive development and also cues to 
              improve usability and accessibility. The website is responsive to screen size and also printing style.
              Each sections are also separated with white lines and marked distinct using title with large texts and 
              special font style. To improve the usability, we should also state more explicitly which fields of input 
              are required, and also make it more obvious where the clickable buttons are at (e.g. the sorting 
              button on the column header). Further, the usability of the page is still not good enough for users 
              with vision and/or hearing deficiencies, or disabilities. In order to improve accessibility for those 
              users, auditory cues and voice control need to be implemented.
            </p>
          <p><strong>1.3.1 Info and Relationships</strong></p>
            <p>
              Each section has a descriptive title which tells the user what the section is about, images are 
              accompanied with captions whenever necessary. However, more labels and descriptions can be 
              added to describe the functionalities and requirements of the tables, buttons, and input fields.
            </p>
          <p><strong>1.4.1 Use of Color</strong></p>
            <p>
              Overall speaking, our web does not depend solely on color to convey information or instructions. 
              Colors are added merely for decoration purposes and to aid readability, so inability to perceive the
              colors won’t affect the usability. Color is also not the only way to provide user with information. For 
              example, for the input fields in the “Best Selling Products” table, the input box turns yellow to 
              indicate that it is the current input field, but users with color blindness is still able to understand this 
              piece of information, since the outline of the input box also becomes thicker, and the cursor would 
              blink. The only information that users with color deficiencies might miss out is whether the link has 
              been visited or not (the link turns greens after being visited)

                We added a label to the table to indicate that the tables 
                can be sorted by clicking the column header. We also amended 
                the css file, so that the clickable column header changes color 
                when the user hovers over it, this tells the user that this is 
                a clickable button. The color changes from black background and 
                white text to white background and black text, so that it is also
                friendly for users with color blindness.

              necessary. However, the page is still not friendly for blind and/or deaf users.
